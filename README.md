# Interview Test - Weather App
Build and run with

`yarn start`

I avoided using Angular CLI as I prefer to understand whats going on under the hood but now I cant get the test runner working!

I pushed my failed attempt using `karma-typrescript` to the branch `karma`. Karma runs but doesn't load the Angular app properly. I'd need more time to investigate and I've already spent a few days on this.

I have written some tests anyway so you can see that I know how unit tests work!
